#### **Prompt: "What I hope to learn in INFO 201"**
I hope to learn more about creating **interactive applications** and data wrangling. Specifically, I am interested in *data cleaning* and the effect of bad data on downstream ***data analysis***.
Some skills I'm excited to learn about include:

1. Data frames
    - Manipulating Rows/Columns
        - Slicing
        - Dropping
        - Adding 
2. Data visualization
    - Reports
    - Interactive plots
